# Fast Matrix Library

## Overview
This project implements basic matrix operations like multiplication and transposition without using external libraries.

## Build Instructions
To build the project, run:
```bash
make
```
To clean the build, run:
```bash
make clean
```
To rebuild the project from scratch, run:
```bash
make re
```

## Usage
Run the executable after building:
```bash
./matrix_test
```

## Future Improvements
- Extend the library to include more complex algebraic operations.

## Features
- High Performance: Uses multithreading to optimize computations.
